# Caverns-maps
Write a computer program which runs on the windows command line with the parameter <file> which opens a cave map file called <file>.cav with up to 10,000 caverns and finds a path from the first cavern to the last cavern writing this to a solution file <file>.csn
Your final program should not write any information to the screen (although you may wish to do this when developing the software). You can choose any language that can produce an executable to be run from the command line as above. Note that some languages will produce code than runs faster than others.
